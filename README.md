A tool to resize images to the various screen densities of Android devices.

##Current version
1.0 (20130502). Download the binary here: [fred-1.1.jar](ttps://github.com/leocadiotine/fred/releases/download/1.1/fred-1.1.jar).

##Purpose
When developing/designing for Android, you have to deal with a bunch of different screen sizes and resolutions. If you design your layouts following the design guidelines and develop them using properly the SDK, you'll have no trouble. Android does all the hard work for you.

But if you don't supply different versions of your image resources for the different screen sizes, Android will resize them at runtime. Therefore, your app will be slow. Because of that, it's always a good idea to supply images on the *drawable-xxhdpi*, *drawable-xhdpi*, *drawable-hdpi*, *drawable-mdpi* and (maybe) *drawable-ldpi* folders.

Doing this on an image editor (like Photoshop) takes time, and it's extremely boring. So why lose time doing that? Fred can do this job for you! And trust me, he would be very happy to help.

##How it works
While designing your layouts, use the [Nexus 5](https://www.google.com/nexus/5/) and its resolution (1920x1080) as the base. After that, slice and export all your image resources.

Then, launch Fred and drag and drop the folder with the images on it. Fred will resize all and create the *drawable-xxhdpi*, *drawable-xhdpi*,  *drawable-hdpi*, *drawable-mdpi* and (optional) *drawable-ldpi* folders for you. After that, just move them to your Android project.

##Usage
Download [the executable jar](https://github.com/leocadiotine/fred/releases/download/1.1/fred-1.1.jar) and double-click it. Fred's window will appear. Drag a folder from your file explorer and drop on it.

You need to have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp) installed to run Fred.
